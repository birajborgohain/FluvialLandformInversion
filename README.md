# FluvialLandformInversion
Code to perform linear inversion of river long profiles to infer tectonic uplift rate history 
The algorithm was presented in:
Goren, L., Fox, M. and Willett, S.D., 2014. Tectonics from fluvial topography using formal linear inversion: Theory and applications to the Inyo Mountains, California. Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface, 119(8), pp.1651-1681.

The code was modified to match the figures produced for a review expected in Treatise on Geomorphology, Second Edition, 2022.
